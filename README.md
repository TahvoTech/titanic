# Titanic Machine Learning Training

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models to predict survival.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
5. **Model Tuning**: Fine-tuning the models to improve their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about the passengers, such as:

- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

## Getting Started
